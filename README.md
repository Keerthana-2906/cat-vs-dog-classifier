# Dogs vs Cats Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify images of dogs and cats using Python and data science techniques. The dataset used for training and testing the classifier consists of labeled images of dogs and cats.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:
- Python (version 3.x)
- collab Notebook (for running the code interactively)
- Libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Keras

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow keras
   
3. Open the collab notebook file (dogs_vs_cats_classification.ipynb)

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains images of dogs and cats. It is available in the data directory of this repository.


## Usage
1. Open the dogs_vs_cats_classification.ipynb notebook.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells sequentially.
3. Train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new images of dogs and cats.

## Results
The notebook contains detailed analysis and evaluation of the classifier's performance. Results, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are presented along with visualizations for better understanding.
